# Ruby Golf Hamburg, 13.11.2013

To start coding on this challenge, first install all gems:

```
bundle install
```

Then, execute the test using guard:

```
bundle exec guard
```

Each time you change ruby_golf.rb, the tests are re-run and give you the state
of your implementation and code metrics used for ranking.
